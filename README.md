# YTclient
simple youtube client using ncurses. browses your sub feed

to execute via shell, python /path/to/YTclient/YTclient.py, copy the link provided, open it in a browser, login, copy text back into the terminal and wait a long time.

to navigate, use the j and k keys to go down and up respectfully. use the m key to open the video in mpv, use the i key to open the thumbnail in feh. media control is currently hard coded. At the moment, you cannot scroll and because of the API that is in use, I cannot garantuee that the results will accurately reflect your sub feed 100% of the time.

todo:

*make a better algorithm:

**live updates
 
 **shorter load times
 
**more accurately reflect your sub feed
 
*implement scrolling

*navigate the entirety of youtube, or at least as much as possible that youtube provides. mainly including:

**comment sections
 
**search
 
**playlists
 
**browsing channels, weather they're ones you've subscribed to or not
 
**Recommended feed?
 
**trending?
 
**suggested topics?
 
*include extra neat tools provided by the API
